# From JavaScript to React

## Updating the UI with JavaScript and DOM Methods
The DOM update the HTML element.
imperative programming (How you should do it) is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. Declarative programming (All is done you just have to do it) is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. 🍕
- React: A declarative UI library.

## Getting Started with React
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax.
React uses JSX which needs to be compiled into JavaScript.

## Essential JavaScript for React
Be [useful](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/from-javascript-to-react/essential-javascript-react) later.

## React Core Concepts
- Components
- Props
    Passing information (variables) to components.
    More cool examples [here](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/from-javascript-to-react/displaying-data-with-props) about how we can use it. 💙
- State
    Hooks allow you to add additional logic such as state to your components.
    Props is read-only information that's passed to components. State is information that can change over time, usually triggered by user interaction.

# How Next.js Works

## Development and Production Environments

- Compiling refers to the process of taking code in one language and outputting it in another language or another version of that language.
- Minification is the process of removing unnecessary code formatting and comments without changing the code’s functionality. The goal is to improve the application’s performance by decreasing file sizes.
- Bundling is the process of resolving the web of dependencies and merging (or ‘packaging’) the files (or modules) into optimized bundles for the browser, with the goal of reducing the number of requests for files when a user visits a web page.

> Compiling is transforming code into something parsable by browsers. Bundling is resolving your applications dependency graph and reducing the number of files.

- Code-splitting is the process of splitting the application’s bundle into smaller chunks required by each entry point. The goal is to improve the application's initial load time by only loading the code required to run that page.

For the (6 -) about Next:
Install the dependencies
```bash 
npm install react react-dom next
```
Run
```bash 
npm run dev
```

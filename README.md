# From JavaScript to React

    ## Updating the UI with JavaScript and DOM Methods
        The DOM update the HTML element.
        imperative programming (How you should do it) is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. Declarative programming (All is done you juste have to do it) is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. üçï
        - React: A declarative UI library.

    ## Getting Started with React
        JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax.
        React uses JSX which needs to be compiled into JavaScript.

    ## React Core Concepts
        - Components
        - Props
            Passing information (variables) to components.
            More cool examples [here](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/from-javascript-to-react/displaying-data-with-props) about how we can use it. üíô
        - State
            Hooks allow you to add additional logic such as state to your components.
            Props is read-only information that's passed to components. State is information that can change over time, usually triggered by user interaction.
